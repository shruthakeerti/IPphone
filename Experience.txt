1. The problems I found :
The main problem is understanding the API's, as API's are new to me, I almost took some four hours to understand.
Delay and breaks were the most annoying problems I found.
2. My approach to debug it:
Initially I gone thorough sample programs, and tried to write the data into a file rather than socket.
I changed the "buffer" size to get break free communication.
3. How you had solved it:
By changing the delay and buffer size.
4. What are problems which are still not solved:
I still have some kind of hissing sound and delay while checking for end to end connection.


What are the improvement you can suggest to make this a better appliance?

I suggest to first compress the data and send on the network, also encryption would give security.
